Hello, I am Svetlan Mauleon, you can call me Svet for short.
I'm currently a student at De La Salle University - Dasmari√±as, and I'm also doing an internship as a frontend developer. It's been a really great experience using what I've learned in the real world. At school, we've been getting into machine learning, working on projects, and solving some tricky machine problems. It's been eye-opening to see how machine learning can have a big impact on real-life stuff, and it's got me super excited to keep learning more about it.
I have a fondness for mystery movies that keep me engaged in guessing the plot twists. The anticipation of not knowing what's coming next adds an exciting element to the viewing experience. Video games are another passion of mine, especially on consoles where I dive into various role-playing games to gain new experiences and immerse myself in captivating virtual worlds. When I'm not unraveling mysteries on screen or embarking on epic quests in video games, I make sure to stay active. Engaging in physical activities like jogging or swimming not only keeps my body healthy but also provides a refreshing break from the digital world. Balancing these interests helps me stay mentally and physically fit while indulging in my love for both cinematic and interactive storytelling.
